##Features of Ansible

Agentless
There is no software or agent to be installed on the client that communicates back to the server.

Idempotent
No matter how many times you call the operation, the result will be the same.

Simple and extensible
Ansible is written in Python and uses YAML for playbook language, both of which are considered relatively easy to learn.
